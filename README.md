# Rust Implementation of the SHA256 Algorithm

Having developed an implementation of the [SHA256 algorithm directly in WebAssembly Text](https://github.com/ChrisWhealy/wasm_sha256), I was pleased to get the compiled binary down to just under 3Kb.

Therefore, I decided to implement the equivalent functionality in Rust, compile it to WebAssembly and see what the size difference is of the two binaries.

Both `.wasm` binaries have been run through `wasm-opt` using the same options, but still the size difference is just over a factor of 20.

## Build

1. `rustup add target wasip1`
2. `cargo build --target=wasm32-wasip1 --release`
3.  ```bash
    wasm-opt ./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/sha256.wasm \
    --enable-simd --enable-multivalue --enable-bulk-memory -O4 \
    -o ./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/sha256_opt.wasm
    ```
4. ```bash
   ll target/wasm32-wasip1/release
   total 480

   ```

As you can see, the optimized `.wasm` binary is about 71Kb compared to the 2.9Kb of the hand-crafted WAT file...

My next task is to investigate ways to make the `.wasm` binary generated by Rust smaller.
